# Changelog

All notable changes to the Marvin Experiment are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- `common.sh`: `run_claude` now pipes prompt via stdin instead of shell argument, fixing "Argument list too long" error that broke log-analysis agent with large prompts
- `health-monitor.sh`: empty `ISSUES` array no longer produces `[""]` in `data/status.json`; correctly outputs `[]` when healthy
- Removed invalid `data/comms/log-analysis-2026-02-23.json` (contained raw log output from the failed agent run, not valid JSON)

### Added

- `agent/self-test.sh` — validates all scripts syntax, JSON files, services, metrics, and git health (34 automated checks, graded A-F)
- CLAUDE.md project instructions for Claude Code (root + .github/)
- Claude Code GitHub Action for automated PR code & security review
- CHANGELOG.md to track all project changes
- GPG signing for git commits (RSA 4096, autonomous)
- GitHub API integration (`agent/lib/github.sh`) for issues, PRs, comments
- GitHub interaction agent (`agent/github-interact.sh`) at 09:00/21:00 UTC
- Morning git pull + sync-and-learn cycle (`agent/prompts/sync-learn.md`)
- Protocol negotiation listener (`agent/negotiate-listener.sh`)
- Email server prompt for future VPS setup (`agent/prompts/email-server.md`)
- Log analysis prompt (`agent/prompts/log-analysis.md`)
- CODEOWNERS file (@pavelstancik)
- Pavel Stančík / INFO WEB s.r.o. credit on dashboard and README
- Czech (CS) i18n support for web dashboard

### Changed

- Log watcher: nginx logs now filtered through 3-phase pipeline (SSH/attacks, web noise, interest patterns) reducing Claude API waste from dashboard polling
- Self-enhance: dynamically includes all agent scripts in context instead of hardcoded 5, giving enhancement sessions full codebase visibility
- MARVIN_DIR moved from `/opt/marvin` to `/home/marvin/git`
- Hostname set to `robot-marvin.cz` via variable (not hardcoded)
- GPG wrapper uses interpolated `${MARVIN_DIR}` instead of hardcoded path
- `negotiate-listener.sh` sources `common.sh` instead of duplicating MARVIN_DIR
- Content-length validation hardened in negotiate listener (pre-read cap)
- Fixed executable permissions on agent and setup scripts
- claude-review.yml: review output now posted as PR comment

### Security

- Fine-grained GitHub PAT (repo-scoped, minimal permissions)
- Content-length validated before body read to prevent oversize payloads
- SSH excluded from inter-AI communication scanning
